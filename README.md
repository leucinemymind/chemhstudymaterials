This is where my study materials for chem are! Find the pdfs :)

Little disclaimer:

I am not, as they call it, a TeXnician (underpaid) so please be patient with me! I don't always follow best practices/convention due to a) finding out too late about the best practice/convention and changing the structure now would take a very long time; b) it looks better that way imo; c) *not* being aware that the best practice/convention exists; d) any or all of the above. (you're totally welcome to pr though! it would just be *really* hard to edit everything because consistency on toppp)
