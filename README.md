This is where my study materials for chem are! Because I tend to make a lot of mistakes and keep having to re-upload the pdfs, I did what needed to be done. The important file is the .pdf in each folder (the other ones are important too but for other reasons). This one repo has been the absolute nicest to me, not giving me any issues at all ... hope we can keep it that way :)

Edit: For all you technical people out there, it's true that these study guides do not always use conventional formatting/best practices. It has been a journey of finding out that these conventions exist. However, they will be (relatively) consistent so hopefully that makes up for it!
